The Ping Pong Game is a digital implementation of the classic 2D game using VHDL (Very High-Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language). It simulates a simple table tennis game where players control paddles to hit the ball back and forth.

## Getting Started

To run and test the Ping Pong Game on your hardware, you will need a FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) development board and a compatible FPGA synthesis tool, such as Xilinx ISE or Vivado.

### Prerequisites

- FPGA Development Board
- FPGA Synthesis Tool (e.g., Xilinx ISE, Vivado)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:


  git clone https://github.com/Mayank-mic/Ping-pong-game.git




2. Open the VHDL project using your FPGA synthesis tool.

3. Synthesize and program the design onto your FPGA development board.

## Usage

- Use the appropriate buttons or switches on your FPGA board to control the left and right paddles.
- The game will start automatically, and the ball will move in a random direction.
- Try to hit the ball with the paddles to prevent it from going off the screen.
- The player who misses the ball loses a point.
- The game continues until one of the players reaches the score limit (default is 5).

## Features

- Digital implementation of the classic 2D Ping Pong Game.
- Use of FPGA and VHDL for hardware-level simulation.
